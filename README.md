# Overview

This repository contains instructions and code for creating an Azure Windows virtual machine (VM) using Terraform. Terraform is a tool for managing infrastructure as code (IaC) that allows you to define and provision your infrastructure in a safe, repeatable, and scalable manner.

By using Terraform to define your infrastructure, you can version your code, maintain consistency between environments, and easily rollback changes if necessary. This approach to managing infrastructure can help you save time and reduce errors, as well as simplify the process of scaling your infrastructure up or down.
